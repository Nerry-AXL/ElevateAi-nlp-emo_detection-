# Emotion Detection using NLP

## Overview

This repository contains a project focused on emotion detection in text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The primary goal of this project is to classify text data into various emotional categories, enabling applications such as sentiment analysis, customer feedback interpretation, and social media monitoring.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes techniques for cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.
- **Emotion Classification**: Implements machine learning models to classify text into emotional categories.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual insights into the data and model performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nerry-AXL/ElevateAi-nlp-emo_detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ElevateAi-nlp-emo_detection
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Emotion_detection.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Data Sources

The dataset used for emotion detection can be found in the `data/` directory. Ensure to check the format and structure of the data before running the analysis.
